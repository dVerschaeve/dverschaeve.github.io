<h2>My technical blog</h2>
<div>
<p>
  I've been in the IT business for quite some time now and during my career I stumbled on countless interesting blog post from others. 
  These posts often led resolving an issue I was working on, helped my broaden my knowledge or triggered me learning new technology areas. Needless to say that the blogging communities helped me a lot evolve to the solution architect I'm today. Now I feel like it's time to start contributing towards the community and help others with technical blog posts.
</p>
<p>
  The idea to start a technology blog is not new, however I kept postponing it for quite some time now. One of the main questions I've asked myself, what do I blog about and in what area. How time consuming will this be, how many post can I produce and how can I offer quality blog posts. I must say that I still don't have all the answers just yet, so instead of postponing I said to myself, let's start and see how it goes and evaluate later on.

  So here we are and I hope you will enjoy my articles and I would value your feedback via one of my contact details on the right.
